# BatToEXE v3.2
Newest sauce [with portable included] I've been able to find via https://github.com/adithya-s-sekhar/advanced-youtube-client-ayc

* Quote below is just from the section of interest that actually seems to be a complete package of the newest/recent/latest version available and not 3.0.8 [think that was last one]
* Only link to really be of interest is the ([IPFS Mirror](http://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPBp7wBSC9GukPUcp7LXFCGXBvc2e45PUfWUbCJzuLG65))
* > IIRC with 3.2 there was something with the menu, but this is based off of use via the installer method, and not really a fan of those to begin with, but also don't think the portable will be any different.    
> I'll save you the time regarding the others listed [disregarding the other apps {ie ffmpeg...}].
* Majorgeeks is the installer only, and not the complete 'package'.
* Repo has 0 repo's [null].
* Didn't bother with site, as it used to just point to the archive.org page for it, so why bother.
